# Machine-Learning-In-Banking
+ I create this project for calculating the probability of unsecured loans based on your information.
+ The data is the banking collection of 45000 people which has 10 features(you can find in bank.csv).
+ I have run my project for approximately 1 million learning_cycles and list of weight result is in 'w_pre.csv'.
+ You can download this project and run it with imported numpy, pandas and matplotlib libraries python 3.6 or higher.
+ You can create new branch and edit my code whenever it has bugs or you want.
Thanks
